# Intelligent-Line-Marking-Robot

ABSTRACT:

In todayâ€™s age robots are used in various fields for various applications. The issue is marking field lines manually in a sports ground especially on gravel or sand grounds, which may lead to error and high time consumption. So we have designed an autonomous line marking bot, which can complete this process with ease. Our robot is aimed to provide accurate marking of any field within less time frame using sensors fusion algorithms to fuse various sensors to accurately localise the robot. Path planning algorithm is then used to navigate the robot to the end position. Simulation of the robot is done in Matlab - Simulink software using the existing libraries. After the simulation is successful the code is tested on an actual robot. The mechanical team will work on the design part. Proper suspensions and  steering mechanisms will be made to overcome the uneven nature or the ground. Finally the code will be optimised and field tested till the desired accuracy is obtained.

SOLUTIONS:

Our bot has the following components to achieve good accuracy in the given time.
*Powder filling tank. 
*GPS, IMU and Odometry will be used for navigation of bot.
*Proximity sensor to help the bot halt if there are any big obstacles.
*Trajectory planning is used for indication in case of any obstacle in its path.
*Notifications of powder level and charge level indicator.
*Actively checking the line drawn using image processing.
*Suspension systems to maintain stability of the bot.
*Hopper mechanism to deploy powder.
*Once charged and powered it can finish marking lines of an hockey ground of perimeter around 450m in 30 minutes.

CURRENT OUTPUT:

*The bot is structurally designed and the electronic mountings were properly placed.
*Assembly of servo motors and driving motors were done.
*The powder tank was made using aluminium sheet.
*The bot was successfully made to move to two given points respectively.
*The kinematic equations worked seamlessly.
*The filter was able to work by taking in the sensor outputs and and give appropriate results.
